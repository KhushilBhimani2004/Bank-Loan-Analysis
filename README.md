### Project Overview
Initially, all data analysis was performed using MS SQL Server. The analysis included calculating KPIs and other essential metrics such as total loan applications, total amount funded, total amount received, good loans, bad loans, average interest rate, and Debt-to-Income (DTI) rate. Additionally, the concepts of Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-Over-Month (MoM) were applied to these metrics for a more detailed analysis.

Subsequently, the data was imported into Power BI for visualization. Using Power BI, data modeling was performed, DAX queries were utilized, and comprehensive dashboards were created to visualize the KPIs and other insights.
